HTML FILE EXPLANATION:

This HTML code defines a basic structure for a Netflix login page. 
It starts with the document type declaration and sets the language to English. 
The head section includes character encoding (UTF-8), a title ("Netflix Login Page"), and links to an external CSS stylesheet ("net.css") for styling. 
The body contains a navigation bar with a logo image linked to the homepage. 
Below the navigation, there is a form wrapped in a "form-wrapper" div, featuring a heading ("Sign In") and two input fields: one for an email or phone number and another for a password, both marked as required. 
A submit button labeled "Sign In" is provided, along with a "Remember me" checkbox and a link for help. Below the form, there's a prompt for new users to sign up, and a note about Google reCAPTCHA for security, with a link to learn more.

CSS FILE EXPLANATION:

This CSS file styles a login page, incorporating the "Roboto" font from Google Fonts and establishing a clean, modern aesthetic. It resets default margins and paddings for all elements and applies a black background to the body. A semi-transparent background image is set to cover the entire viewport using a pseudo-element. The navigation bar is fixed at the top with specific padding and a z-index to ensure it stays on top of other elements. The form wrapper is centrally positioned with rounded corners and a dark, semi-transparent background. The heading is styled in white with a larger font size. Each form control has a height and margin for spacing, with inputs having a dark background that changes on focus or valid input. Labels inside inputs transition in size and position when the input is focused or valid, creating an animated effect. The submit button is prominently styled in Netflix's signature red, with hover effects for interactivity. Links and text elements are styled for readability, with specific colors and hover effects. The layout is responsive, adjusting elements' sizes and positions for screens smaller than 740px, such as hiding the background image and altering padding for the nav and form.
